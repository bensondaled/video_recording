To make a recording:
(1) Open the "video_recording" folder where this instruction file lives
(2) Edit desired parameters in the acq.py file (open it in TextMate, not TextEdit)
(3) Double-click run.sh and follow instructions
(4) Recordings are saved in the "data" folder within this video_recording folder

To view a recording:
(1) Open VLC
(2) Drag the avi file of interest from the data folder into VLC to play it
(3) Timestamps for each frame are in the accompanying text file 

Tips and Troublshooting:
(1) Highly recommended: each time you begin an experiment, confirm that this setup works by doing a test recording and inspecting it.
(2) High framerates/resolution can lead to difficulties in saving properly. Perform a test for each recording parameter you change.
(3) If anything acts strange, close all windows, then disconnect and reconnect the camera. Then try again.
